Star rating system
======

A simple star rating system made with PHP/MySQL and JS.
Made upon a tutorial from CodeBoxx but refactored to respect a more object-oriented mindset.

**If you want to test this code :**

+ Create a DB with 2 tables "products" and "star_rating" according to "database.sql" instructions.
+ Create a .env file inside /src and add your own server infos.

If you have any tips or recommendations, don't hesitate to get it touch on Github !
